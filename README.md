Fitness-Monitor
===============
Recently joining the Planet Fitness fitness center (some call it a gym), I realized something: I could turn this into a fun project.

When it comes to doing weights and such I have to log each day I go with the amount of weights I used.  Well, why not record the weight, how many sets and reps I did, and graph it in a happy little experiment?

Welcome this.

How To Use
-----------
Initially there's no security to this.  Mostly due to wanting to get the main system
up and running first.

Just make sure Tornado is installed and run main.py, then access the site.

More features will be added throughout dev.

Database backend is SQLite as everything else is overkill IMO.
