Fitness-Monitor
===============
Recently joining the Planet Fitness fitness center (some call it a gym), I realized something: I could turn this into a fun project.

When it comes to doing weights and such I have to log each day I go with the amount of weights I used.  Well, why not record the weight, how many sets and reps I did, and graph it in a happy little experiment?

Welcome this.
